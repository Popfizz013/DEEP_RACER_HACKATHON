# AWS DeepRacer Hackathon

The AWS DeepRaer Hackathon hoster by the University of Victoria is an exciting opportunity for us to dive into machine learning. Through this 
Hacathon we will explore reinforcement learning, and build an autonoumous racing model wich will be implemented on a AWS DeepRacer, a 1/18th scale
car designed to race using AI.

## Event Overview

With AWS DeepRacer, we can train models in the cloud using Amazon SageMaker and test them on a physical track. This hackathon will challenge us to train, optimize, and compete with our very own DeepRacer models!

### Important Dates

- **Office Hours**: November 13th  
  *A chance to consult with mentors and clarify any questions we have before testing.*

- **Testing**: November 18th  
  *Our teams will get access to the track to test models and make real-world adjustments.*

- **Race Day**: November 19th  
  *The official AWS DeepRacer Race will be held on campus!*

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Setting Up AWS DeepRacer (Due November 13th)

1. **Create AWS Account**  
   Each of us needs access to AWS. We’ll set up our individual or shared accounts and apply for AWS credits if available.

2. **Configure AWS DeepRacer Console**  
   I’ll log in to the AWS DeepRacer console, go over the platform's tutorials, and get comfortable with the interface for training, evaluation, and track setup.

3. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - First, I’ll define our reward function—a crucial part of our reinforcement learning model.
   - Then, we’ll tune hyperparameters, like learning rate and exploration settings, to balance model performance and adaptability.

### Step 2: Model Training (Due November 18th)

1. **Pre-training Model Testing**  
   - We’ll run initial tests on the AWS virtual simulator, checking metrics like completion time and lap consistency.
   - Based on the simulation feedback, we’ll adjust the reward function and hyperparameters.

2. **Fine-tuning with Simulated Data**  
   - Insights from the simulator will help us refine the model’s performance.
   - Together, we’ll work on any errors to improve efficiency and consistency.

3. **Preparing for Physical Testing**  
   We’ll export the model, ready for testing on the physical DeepRacer device on November 18th.

### Step 3: Real-World Testing (November 18th)

On testing day, we’ll get a chance to run our models on the actual track, record performance, and make any physical-world adjustments we find necessary. The data from this session will guide our final tweaks before race day.

### Step 4: Race Day (November 19th)

All teams will compete on our custom DeepRacer track! Performance will be evaluated based on completion time and track consistency, with prizes for the top finishers.
