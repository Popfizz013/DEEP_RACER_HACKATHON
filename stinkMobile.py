def reward_function(params):
    """
    Reward function for AWS DeepRacer to guide the car toward optimal behavior on the track.

    The function assigns rewards based on the car's position relative to the center line, 
    its heading (to determine if it's on a straightaway or curve), and its steering angle. 
    The goal is to promote smooth driving, maintain track adherence, and minimize unnecessary 
    corrections, ensuring efficient lap completion.

    Args:
        params (dict): A dictionary of parameters provided by the AWS DeepRacer environment. Includes:
            - track_width (float): The width of the track.
            - distance_from_center (float): The distance of the car from the center line of the track.
            - is_left_of_center (bool): True if the car is on the left side of the center line, False otherwise.
            - all_wheels_on_track (bool): True if all wheels of the car are on the track, False otherwise.
            - steering_angle (float): The steering angle of the car in degrees.
            - heading (float): The current heading of the car in degrees.

    Returns:
        float: A reward value indicating how favorable the car's current state is for the given conditions.
